# Hodor-server

## About
Hodor-server is a very simple CAS protocol implementation, in Rails.
At the moment this repository is just proof of concept, and should not be expected to reach production-level maturity any time soon (if ever)

In summary: I really wouldn't use this yet if I were you.

It's being developed following TDD as part of a training mechanism inside my current company.

* Ruby version 2.4.1
* No database really configured yet
* Clone it, bundle it
* `$ rspec`
